I was struggling with a breakup and seeking reentry into the job-market, Zantu helped me with finding a new perspective, she gave me direct feedback in a way that was helpful and told me truths in a way that I understood part of the breakup that was messing with my emotions for a while. I'm still working through some of the fallout, but it went a new way that helps me feel better.
