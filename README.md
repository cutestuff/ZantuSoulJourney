It was likely bringing attention to the way I speak to myself in a deprecating manner which I never really looked into nor even noticed until now which I'll evaluate if it's an issue or not.
I'd also like to appreciate the gentleness of the way you spoke to me about the issue which would've helped a lot if I already knew the issue and felt insecure about it but I'm only now just noticing it now thanks to you, ma'am. (edited)

After talking to you for awhile I realized that there was a pattern in the way that my boyfriend and I communicate, and from then on it’s easier to see how I can communicate better with him. You’ve helped me realize that there are some things that I do when I communicate that could trigger my boyfriend’s fight or flight mode and ways that I could avoid doing that to have a better communication with him. Thank you!! I’m going to try it out and see if there is a progress. I’m more hopeful now that we’ve figured it out

I’m sorry for the late response, it was the way you broke down the concepts that was easy to understand, For example, when I commented on the cool shading; you then showed me how light can mix and bounce off other objects creating different hues!
Additionally you had great art wisdom! It was really good and I’m still actually drawing because you explained the importance of consistency and letting go of the fear of failure. I think both of these are extremely valuable and awesome!

I was struggling with a breakup and seeking reentry into the job-market, Zantu helped me with finding a new perspective, she gave me direct feedback in a way that was helpful and told me truths in a way that I understood part of the breakup that was messing with my emotions for a while. I'm still working through some of the fallout, but it went a new way that helps me feel better.
